             <p>Duodeka is an initiative of Tilburg IT entrepreneurs who joined forces in 2015. In principle, our joint passions for business and IT have led to an informal partnership. Not much later, our first office at Prof. Verbernelaan was a fact.

                After a year and a half working on prof. Verbernelaan, the next step was taken: an office in the beautiful Nwe Faxx in the center of Tilburg. We have already been able to carry out many projects for our clients, we are extremely proud of this. Our team has also grown considerably, just like our subsidiaries: Mr. Winston and Minutes Software .
